# CoolCatsSimpleSnapShot

Simple script to snapshot a NFT token from the custom contract

## Fill in some constants
You will find a few constants in `src/index.js` that need to be filled out.
- CONTRACT_ADDRESS
- INFURA_KEY

## Where to get INFURA_KEY
You can grab your Infura key from https://infura.io/

## Use
`npm run start`

### Note
This code is intended as a learning piece. Consider it as a starting point. You might want to improve the code with more error catching, maybe convert it to typescript, maybe put all the constants in and .env file.

Lots of ways to improve this code - have fun :)
